# Programming Language & Tools

## Programming Language
The virtual CPU emulator will be implemented in **C++** due to its:

- **Performance**: C++ offers high performance and memory control, allowing efficient emulation of low-level hardware operations.
- **Library Support**: C++ has rich libraries for bitwise operations, memory management, and custom data structures, making it ideal for CPU emulation.

## Tools

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is recommended for development, providing robust support for C++ through extensions, debugging tools, and Git integration.
- **Compiler**: GCC or Clang will be used to compile the C++ code.
- **Unit Testing Framework**: **Google Test** is chosen for unit testing, as it is widely used for C++ and allows comprehensive testing of CPU components like the ALU and memory.
- **Documentation**: Project documentation will be maintained in Markdown format and hosted on GitHub, enabling collaboration and easy version control.

These tools offer a reliable setup for developing, testing, and managing the virtual CPU emulator in C++.
