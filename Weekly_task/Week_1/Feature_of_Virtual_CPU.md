# Features of the Virtual CPU

The virtual CPU emulator is designed to simulate the core functionalities of a basic CPU, allowing users to experiment with CPU operations in a virtual setting.

## Key Features

1. **Basic Instruction Set**: Supports essential instructions, such as `ADD`, `SUB`, `LOAD`, and `STORE`, to perform arithmetic and memory operations.
2. **Registers**: Includes general-purpose registers for temporarily holding data during computations.
3. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Implements arithmetic and logic operations, mimicking the processing power of a CPU.
4. **Program Counter (PC)**: Keeps track of the current instruction location in memory, advancing as each instruction executes.
5. **Instruction Cycle**: Follows a fetch-decode-execute cycle to emulate the fundamental operation of a CPU.
6. **Memory Management**: Supports basic memory allocation with read and write capabilities.
7. **Input/Output (Optional)**: Simulates basic I/O devices (e.g., keyboard, display) for simple input and output operations.
8. **Simple Assembler**: Converts assembly code into machine code that the virtual CPU can process.

This feature set will facilitate testing and provide insights into CPU architecture and operations within an emulated environment.
