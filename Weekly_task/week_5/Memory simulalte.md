# Memory Segmentation Documentation  

## Overview  
Memory segmentation divides memory into logical sections or **segments** to organize and manage memory efficiently. Each segment has a specific purpose, such as storing data, code, or stack operations, ensuring a cleaner and more structured virtual memory space.

---

## Key Concepts  

### 1. **Memory Segments**  
- **Code Segment**: Stores program instructions.  
- **Data Segment**: Stores variables and constants.  
- **Stack Segment**: Manages function calls, return addresses, and local variables.  

Each segment can be addressed individually using segment identifiers and offsets.

### 2. **Address Mapping**  
Memory addresses are split into two components:  
- **Segment Identifier**: Identifies the specific memory segment.  
- **Offset**: Specifies the location within the segment.  

For example:  
```
[Segment: data, Offset: 5]
```
This refers to the **data segment** at memory address `5`.

## Features Implemented  

1. **Simulated Memory Space**  
   - Memory is organized as a single array, representing a virtual memory of fixed size.  

2. **Read/Write Operations**  
   - Data can be written to and read from specific segments using offsets.  

3. **Segmented Addressing**  
   - Each memory operation identifies the target segment and offset.  

4. **Printing Non-Zero Values**  
   - The memory content is displayed with non-zero values, indicating active data locations.

## Task Details  

### Writing to Memory  
Write data to a specific segment and offset.  
Example:  
```
Write [Segment: data, Offset: 5] = 42
Write [Segment: data, Offset: 10] = 84
```

### Reading from Memory  
Read data from a specific segment and offset.  
Example:  
```
Read [Segment: data, Offset: 5]: 42
Read [Segment: data, Offset: 10]: 84
```

### Displaying Memory Content  
The system prints memory content with active data locations.  
Example Output:  
```
Memory Content:
[5]=42 [10]=84
```

## Benefits of Memory Segmentation  
- **Logical Organization**: Divides memory into manageable sections.  
- **Isolation**: Prevents unintended overlap between data and code.  
- **Scalability**: Makes it easier to manage larger memory spaces.

## Example Output  

**Program Execution**:
```
Select Task:
1. Previous Execution Logic
2. Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle
3. Memory Management
Enter choice: 3
```

**Output**:  
```
Testing Memory Management:
Read Data [Segment: data, Offset: 5]: 42
Read Data [Segment: data, Offset: 10]: 84
Memory Content:
[5]=42 [10]=84
```

---

## Future Enhancements  
- **Dynamic Memory Segments**: Allow runtime segment allocation.  
- **Error Handling**: Validate invalid segment access or memory overflow.  
- **Segment Limits**: Introduce boundaries for each segment.

---

## Conclusion  
This documentation outlines the **Memory Segmentation** implementation for managing virtual memory. It highlights segmented addressing, read/write operations, and the organization of logical memory spaces.
